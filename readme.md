Things I like to do in Berkeley: 

* Stay safe during quarantine 

* Cook tasty meals 

* Study hard for class!

My plans for the weekend are: 

1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class 

2. Double-check that I completed all of Professor Jeremy's assignments 

3. Triple-check that all assignments are done
